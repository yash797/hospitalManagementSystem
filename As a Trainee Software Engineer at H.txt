As a Trainee Software Engineer at HSBC, the past four months have been a period of accelerated growth, both technically and personally. My journey began with a week-long induction program filled with insightful sessions, leadership talks, and engaging activities that laid a strong foundation for my understanding of HSBC’s values and corporate culture. Following this, I completed a six-week intensive training on key technologies—Java, JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Spring Boot, AWS, Docker, and Jenkins—where I honed my technical skills by consistently completing daily assignments, demonstrating my commitment to learning, and embracing HSBC’s "We Get It Done" value.

One of the standout experiences during my training was participating in the CodeFury hackathon. Leading my team in developing a hospital management system, we leveraged HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, with Core Java, MySQL for the backend, and JUnit for unit testing. Our design included Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), Class Diagrams, ER Diagrams, and test cases. This experience strengthened my skills in collaboration, problem-solving, and project leadership, embodying HSBC’s "We Succeed Together" value.

Additionally, I completed my White Belt certification on Secure Code Warrior, achieving a score of 81.16%. This certification provided me with a strong foundation in secure coding practices, aligning with HSBC’s commitment to high standards in compliance and risk management.

Upon joining my team, I took on an API Developer role focused on HSBC's PAPI and SAPI systems. My initial weeks included knowledge transfer sessions to understand our product ecosystem and how APIs like PAPI, SAPI, and eAPI interact to serve our customers. I proactively completed training modules on both PAPI and SAPI to deepen my understanding, ensuring I was well-prepared for upcoming assignments.

One of my initial tasks was conducting a performance test on the /confirm-domestic-payments endpoint for domestic payments. The objective was to ensure that the system could handle high traffic and maintain resilience under peak loads. This involved end-to-end performance testing steps, including creating backend stubs in Postman and converting them to JMX files for JMeter, followed by running various test scenarios. I carried out smoke tests, capacity tests, and soak tests to validate system resilience and documented detailed results. These reports can be found here: [Performance Testing Reports]. By focusing meticulously on each testing stage, I ensured our product met quality standards, aligning with HSBC’s "We Take Responsibility" value by actively supporting the bank’s commitment to rigorous standards.

This task brought several challenges. As I was new to JMeter, configuring realistic load tests and analyzing results proved to be a learning curve. To overcome these hurdles, I researched the JMeter documentation and various technical blogs and sought guidance from colleagues experienced in performance testing. This blend of independent learning and collaborative support allowed me to confidently conduct comprehensive tests and produce detailed insights.

Recently, I completed the MQ certificate renewal project across multiple APIs. This task required me to monitor live traffic on Splunk, analyze production deployments, create secure GitHub branches, and deploy updates through Jenkins pipelines. The experience reinforced my understanding of our deployment processes and furthered my skills in managing critical updates. Currently, I am involved in MQ upgrades for additional APIs, a project that speaks to HSBC’s focus on continuous improvement and sustainability. Through these experiences, I have not only expanded my technical expertise but also demonstrated a proactive approach to overcoming challenges, aligning with HSBC's commitment to quality and resilience.

There was a time when our team was tasked with deploying APIs for Mexico transfer, which required an overnight deployment. The API team worked diligently until 2:30 a.m. to ensure the process was completed smoothly. While I couldn’t contribute directly to the deployment, I observed the entire procedure, gaining valuable insights into the complexities of live deployment and how our team collaborates under tight timelines to deliver critical functionalities.

Day-to-day, I actively participate in daily scrum calls, where I discuss my ongoing tasks, share blockers, and stay aligned with team objectives. These calls foster transparency, enabling me to seek assistance if needed and contribute to ongoing team discussions. When new tasks or projects arise, I make it a priority to observe and learn, ensuring that I stay engaged across various activities. This proactive approach has helped me build a holistic understanding of our team’s responsibilities and goals.

My journey at HSBC has been filled with opportunities to tackle complex challenges, which I approach with a readiness to learn and adapt. Embracing such tasks not only enhances my skills but also underscores my determination to exceed expectations. Each experience boosts my confidence and reinforces my commitment to high performance, creating a positive and productive work environment for myself and my team.

As I continue my work, I am eager to expand my skills further and contribute more deeply to HSBC’s objectives. I’m currently working towards achieving my AWS Certified Developer – Associate certification by December, aiming to strengthen my technical expertise. In addition, I participated in a CSR tree-planting initiative with the BAIF Institute for Sustainable Livelihoods and Development, which aligns closely with HSBC’s commitment to community support and sustainability. I am sincerely grateful for the opportunities HSBC has provided, and I look forward to making an even greater impact within the organization.
